# About
This is a python project on Symbian v3 to keep billing. As the application is mainly inspired by GnuCash, much function is the same. It features double-entry bookkeeping system, multiple document and view, intelligent interactive dialog, convient navigation and auto settling.

It's definitely the biggest project developed before I enter the university. And I've also rewritten the project several times to boost performance and make the code clear. The whole code is written with my Nokia E71 mobile phone. I think it can be a monument for my early development.

# Dependency
It requires PyS60 to run this program.
